Civic Nest – A Grassroots Civic Feedback Platform
Civic Nest is a simple yet powerful civic-tech prototype that empowers citizens to rate public spaces based on key amenities like sanitation, safety, lighting, and accessibility. It is designed to help city planners and local governments identify high-performing areas and zones that need urgent improvement.
