# Civic Nest – Civic Feedback Platform

**Civic Nest** is a simple yet powerful data collection prototype idea that I came up with on my own. It empowers citizens to rate public spaces based on key amenities like sanitation, safety, lighting, cleanliness and accessibility. It was designed to help city planners and local governments identify zones that need urgent improvement.


##  Project Highlights

*  **Anonymous Ratings** – No login needed; fast, one-click submissions
*  **Public-Driven Insights** – Real feedback from on-ground citizens
*  **Low-Code Stack** – Built with HTML, JavaScript, and Google Sheets backend
*  **Civic Nest Zones** – Areas with consistently high ratings are flagged as model public spaces

##  How It Works

1. Users visit the rating webpage
2. Select a famous public spot in Chandgarh (e.g., Sukhna Lake, ISBT 17, Elante Mall)
3. Give 1–5 star ratings on key factors like:

   * Sanitation
   * Security
   * Lighting
   * Accessibility
   * Cleanliness
4. The data is submitted to a central Google Sheet in real-time

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **Frontend:** HTML + CSS + JavaScript
* **Backend:** Google Apps Script + Google Sheets
* **Hosting:** GitHub Pages (free and public)

## 💡 Potential Impact

* Helps identify **neglected zones** needing civic improvement
* Recognizes and promotes **well-maintained public spaces**
* Supports inclusion by tracking **accessibility and safety**
* Can be scaled **across Indian cities** with minimal infrastructure
